# DES Encryption Algorithm  


## 🚀 Features  
- Converts a text input into an 8-bit binary format.  
- Splits the binary representation into two segments.  
- Applies bitwise left shifts for transformation.  
- Introduces randomness to create encryption keys.  
- Generates a set of 8 encryption keys.  

## 🛠 Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x installed on your system.  
- Basic familiarity with running Python scripts.  

## 🔍 How It Works  

### 1️⃣ Binary Conversion  
The provided text is converted into its binary equivalent.  
#### Example:  
```bash
Input: "Hello"
Binary: 0100100001100101011011000110110001101111
